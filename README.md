
# Fortnite Skin Swap Generator
Automatically generates CP swap codes. That should work perfectly
# TODO
 1. [x] Fix other skins than the default skin crashing when you play a second game
 2. [ ] Maybe port it to something else than Python
 3. [ ] Make a Youtube Tutorial for it
 4. [ ] Clean up the code
# How to use it?
 1. Install Python (Make sure you add it to PATH)
 2. Clone the repo
 3. Run modules.bat
 4. Open start.bat to start the script
 5. When it's done generating. You should see an output.txt file which has the generated skin swap "code"
